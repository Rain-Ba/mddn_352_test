                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p>We have seen a lot of traditional hiking apps. The innovation of this app is to make the outdoor activity of hiking more interesting and I hope it can combine the game with real life. In this application, you can continuously challenge yourself and accumulate more coins in exchange for different rewards.</p>

                <p>Here are some mockup about discover and map in this App. </p>
                <p>In the discovery of this page, it is mainly to show the location and corresponding difficulty of the hiking, as well as the time to complete.
                    In the map page, this page is mainly to show the specific route and some hidden features.</p>

				<h3>Unlock Discover</h3>
				<p>Here are some low-level routes, and users can choose to go hiking. These primary routes can be completed in an hour to three hours. Adopting such a path to relax when the user is busy is the best choice.</p>

				<h3>Locked Discover</h3>
				<p>These locked locations are high-level routes that can be unlocked when you complete the previous low-level course. These routes will gradually increase the difficulty, and the level will increase progressively, including time and distance, which requires sufficient experience to complete.</p>

				<h3>Map</h3>
				<P>We all know that there are almost no signals on mobile phones in the mountains, so it is difficult to see where you are. We can download these maps before departure so that it will be more convenient to use.</P>
                <P>There are thumbnails of some maps at the top of this page, so you can more easily choose where you want to go. The middle part is a large map with some symbols on it, and you can find the exact location of these places. Some of them will set up QR code scanning. When you have finished scanning, you can win the corresponding points, and you can exchange what you need in the support station.</P>

				<P>In our profile, we show our achievements including grades, gold coins, and sports information. The sports information details the mileage values you have traveled, the time spent and the number of calories burned.</P>
                <P>The most important part is the bottom part, which records the route you have traveled. You can refresh these routes repeatedly to accumulate more coins.</P>

				<h3>Friend chat</h3>
				<P>The main advantage of hiking is that you can walk alone or with friends, and you can meet new friends with similar interests. In this section, you can talk privately with your friends or form a group to exchange experiences and share achievements.
                </P>

				<h3>Support Station</h3>
				<P>The support station is also a highlight of this app, which can tie your achievements to real life.</P>
                <P>This parts similar to a virtual store where you can check the value of the gold coins you receive for the daily redemption of the products. Later, some merchants will come to support this part of the operation. I believe more businesses will sponsor this set.</P>
